module Data.Aeson where

type Value = String

--Note, this is just here since I haven't set up stackage and cabal like I
--want to, so this is a placeholder for the imported module until I figure
--all of that out and get it working
--For now I just wanted to put the idea in here that the program is going
--to be encoding and decoding JSON at the end of it and I really just want
--to show that idea in the structure of the code so I don't get caught up in
--"well how is the flow of the program actually going to work?"
